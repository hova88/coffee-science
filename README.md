# Pour-Over Coffee Visualizer

An interactive, high-fidelity 3D visualization of pour-over coffee brewing physics, designed to help enthusiasts understand the invisible variables that affect flavor.

## Features

### 1. Physics-Based Voxel Engine
A custom WebGL rendering engine built on Three.js that simulates thousands of individual particles to represent coffee grounds, water flow, and extraction dynamics.
*   **Fluid Dynamics**: Visualizes flow velocity and turbulence.
*   **Extraction Heatmaps**: Color-coded particles show real-time extraction levels (Sour -> Sweet -> Bitter).
*   **Saturation & Channeling**: Simulates how water saturates the coffee bed and identifies potential channeling risks.

### 2. Interactive Brewing Variables
Adjust real-world brewing parameters and instantly see their impact on the simulation and predicted flavor profile.
*   **The Grind**: Adjust particle size from "Turkish Fine" to "French Press Coarse".
*   **The Water**: Control temperature (80°C - 100°C) and brew ratio (1:10 - 1:20).
*   **The Pour**: Modulate agitation and pour structure (Continuous vs. Pulse).

### 3. Real-Time Flavor Prediction
The application calculates a theoretical flavor profile based on your current settings using SCA (Specialty Coffee Association) principles.
*   **Acidity vs. Bitterness**: See how grind size and temperature shift the balance.
*   **Body & Clarity**: Visualize the trade-off between heavy body and flavor separation.
*   **TDS & Extraction Yield**: Estimates strength and efficiency.

### 4. Educational Insights
*   **Dynamic Taste Feedback**: As you adjust sliders, the app provides immediate feedback on how that change will likely alter the cup (e.g., "Finer grind increases body but risks bitterness").
*   **Scientific Visualizers**: 3B1B-inspired graphs visualize abstract concepts like particle surface area and thermal solubility.

## Tech Stack

*   **Core**: React 19, TypeScript
*   **3D Engine**: Three.js (WebGL)
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
*   **Effects**: Custom Post-Processing (Unreal Bloom, Tone Mapping)
*   **Icons**: Lucide React

## Usage

1.  **Explore the Model**: Click and drag to rotate the 3D brewer. Scroll to zoom.
2.  **Focus Points**: Click the glowing dots ("The Water", "The Grind", "The Pour") to open detailed control panels.
3.  **Adjust & Learn**: Drag the sliders to see the simulation morph in real-time. Watch the "Taste Tendency" indicators to understand the flavor impact.
4.  **View Modes**: Use the toggle buttons on the right to switch between "Reality", "Saturation" (Water flow), and "Velocity" (Speed) views.

## Run Locally

To run this project on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository**

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

This project can be easily deployed to GitHub Pages.

1.  **Install the `gh-pages` package**
    ```bash
    npm install gh-pages --save-dev
    ```

2.  **Update `package.json`**
    
    Add your specific GitHub URL to the top level of the JSON:
    ```json
    "homepage": "https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>",
    ```

    Add the deployment scripts to the `"scripts"` section:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "predeploy": "npm run build",
      "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist",
      // ... existing scripts
    }
    ```

3.  **Deploy**
    Run the deploy command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```
    This will build the project and push it to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository.
